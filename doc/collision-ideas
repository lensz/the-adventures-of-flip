collision-ideas

collision-rect:
- one 'full-body'-rect (as big as the sprite as the entity)
	- used for a quick test if there are more test (with body-part-rect) necessary
- smaller 'body-part'-rects inside this rect
	- position: relative to upperleft-corner of the full-body rect
	- dimensions: fixed px
	- position+dimensions has to be <= full-body-rect and >= 0
