Ideas for the xml-level-specification

map-file:
- two files: level, entity
- dimensions are redundant: calculate from grid node?
- 'nextLvl'-information not in the mapFile. should be a separate(xml)-document

entity-file'
- rename entitiesInfo and entities nodes
- rename 'points' to something better
- 'life' is it relly life or only hp?
- dimensions are redundant: calculate from colrects?
- mapFie information is not needed?
